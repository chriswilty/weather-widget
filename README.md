# Weather Widget

A very simple weather widget, intended as a demo for the React Hooks API.

Weather Icons courtesy of [owfont](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/).

Project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I wouldn't normally use this
as I feel it is overkill, however, it's a quick way to get up and running with a demo app.

## Run me!

This project uses [Yarn 2 zero-installs](https://next.yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs), so simply clone/fork the repo, then:

```
yarn start
```

This runs the app in development mode (using webpack server with hot-reloading). Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in a browser.

Any lint errors will be visible in the console.

## Widget me!

If you want to see it as a desktop widget, give OpenFin a try:

```
yarn start
yarn dlx -p openfin-cli openfin --launch --config openfin.json
```
