# Weather Widget

A very simple weather widget, intended as a demo for the React Hooks API.

Weather Icons courtesy of [owfont](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/).

Project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I wouldn't normally use this
as I feel it is overkill, however, it's a quick way to get up and running with a demo app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory:

### `yarn start`

Run the app in development mode (with hot-reloading).  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in a browser.
  
Any lint errors will be visible in the console.
