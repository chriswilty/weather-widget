/**
 * This version of the widget uses setInterval to set the weather location every
 * N seconds.
 *
 * Logic for selecting location at an interval is provided in custom hooks - see
 * hooks/interval. Note that the callback passed to setInterval cannot access
 * "future" state values from a useState hook (only the "current" state value is
 * accessible, even in a closure), instead we must use a ref hook to store the
 * location value, which we CAN use in a callback to retrieve the current value,
 * as Refs are guaranteed to persist for the lifetime of a component.
 * See hooks/rolloverCount.
 *
 * However, by design useRefs do not trigger updates, so we need to force an
 * update with some hooks trickery - see hooks/useForceUpdate.
 *
 * As you will gather, the logic in this version of the widget is far more
 * complex than the one using setTimeout. While it remains as an example of how
 * to achieve this behaviour using setInterval, your fellow developers will
 * thank you for avoiding setInterval when needing to access application state!
